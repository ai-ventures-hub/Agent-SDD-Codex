# Agent-SDD Universal Framework Directory

This directory contains the Agent-SDD Universal Framework, a multi-platform framework for structured software development that works across Claude, Grok, and GitHub Copilot (Codex).

## Quick Reference

For complete documentation, see the main project README.md in the parent directory.

### Key Features
- **Universal Compatibility**: Single framework works across all major AI coding assistants
- **Platform Auto-Detection**: Automatically adapts to your AI environment
- **16 Specialized Agents**: Comprehensive agent system for development workflows
- **11 Workflow Commands**: Structured development process from planning to deployment
- **Living Architecture**: Automatic Mermaid diagram generation and maintenance

### Getting Started
1. Use Codex-first `#sdd-task` commands (universal `sdd-task` alias still works)
2. Start with `#sdd-task --init` for project analysis
3. Follow the structured workflow: init → spec → execute → improve

### Platform Support
- **Codex**: `#sdd-task` (default in this edition; sequential execution inside VS Code)
- **Claude**: `/sdd-task` (automatic loading, sub-agent orchestration)
- **Grok adapter**: `@sdd-task` (manual bootstrap required, sequential execution)

### Directory Structure
