### 2025-10-02 | Bug Fix - Phase Completion Check for Sequential Execution
Fixed roadmap checkbox updates not working in Grok/Codex sequential execution mode
- Files: .codex/commands/workflows/execute.md
- Issue: Logger agent's phase completion check only worked in Claude's sub-agent orchestration, failed in sequential simulation
- Fix: Added explicit PHASE_COMPLETION_CHECK step to execute workflow that works across all execution models
- Status: completed
- Impact: Roadmap checkboxes now properly update [ ] → [x] when phases complete in all platforms (Claude, Grok, Codex)
